<h3>1: Omit certain results</h3>
          
    <p>This is my most used "Hack" for searching through the millions of results found when performing a search.</p>
<p>You might think: "Why would I not want certain results to come up?"
<br>Well, one example would be:</p>
<p>You may be trying to create a spreadsheet on a certain program other than Excel. However, every time you search for "How to fix my spreadsheet", the results that show will <strong>ALL</strong> be aimed at people using Excel.
    
So to omit all the results that contain the word "Excel" you'd simply type a "<strong>-</strong>" symbol before the word you'd like to get rid of. So now your search would be:</p>
<p>"How to fix my spreadsheet -excel"</p>
<p>Cycle through the two images below to see the difference in searches.</p>
<div id="myCarousel" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">

  <!-- Wrapper for slides -->
  <div class="carousel-inner" role="listbox">
    <div class="item active">
     <img src="../../images/google-excel.png" alt="Excel Results Showing" />
    </div>

    <div class="item">
        <img src="../../images/google-no-excel.png" alt="Excel Results NOT Showing" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Left and right controls -->
  <a class="left carousel-control" href="#myCarousel" role="button" data-slide="prev">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
  </a>
  <a class="right carousel-control" href="#myCarousel" role="button" data-slide="next">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
  </a>
</div>

    
    
<p>Ta da! You've just found the results you want! Easy!</p>
<h3>2: Search for images</h3>
<p>This one is especially useful for all you uni students that need to reference the source of all the images you might have used in a project.</p>
<p>
This one is as simple as going to Google images and clicking the small camera icon inside the search bar. This will allow you to upload a photo, search the internet for said photo and find out which website it came from! Great huh!? See the image below for the camera icon mentioned above.

</p>
<h3>3: Use quotes to search for an exact phrase</h3>
<p>This is one of the better known tricks and it's really simple.</p>
<p>If you incase your search in quotation marks it will search for that exact phrase! Especially useful for song lyrics, quotes or finding where you read something.</p>
<h3>4: Use an asterisk in a search phrase to represent variable or unknown words</h3>
<p>This one's especially useful if you can't remember part of a quote or you can't quite make out a word in a song lyric.<br>Using an asterisk in the place of a word will search for all variations of that phrase. For example: Searching for "Livin on a *" will show you Bon Jovi's Livin' on a Prayer
<img src="../../images/bon-jovi.png" alt="Livin on a * Search" />
</p>
<h3>5: Compare two foods by using <srtong>vs</srtong></h3>
<p>If you're the dieting type, this trick will be great for you! To see two foods and their nutritional content compared just type "<strong>Food 1</strong>vs <strong>Food 2</strong>"
<br> Great aint it!?
<img src="../../images/food-vs.png" alt="Food VS" /></p>
<h3>Just for fun!</h3>
<p>Lastly, just for a bit of fun, incase you were struggling for ideas with which to procrastinate, try going to <a href="https://images.google.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Google Images</strong></a> and typing "Atari Breakout" into the search field. Enjoy!</p>
